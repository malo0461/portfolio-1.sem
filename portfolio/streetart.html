        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>The brief for this projekt was to make a site about a historical art movement directed at 13 to 16 year olds. My subject was street art.</p>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>First step was to make the <a href="img/portfolio/streetart/Street%20Art_Malou.pdf" class="red">content</a> for the site. It had to appeal to the target group while being informative. I researched relevant text and pictures, and selected artists for exemplification based also on my own knowledge of the scene, so that it would have a contemporary touch.</p>

        <h1>Process</h1>

        <p>Next came designing the visual expression of the site. It should be responsive to the most common screen sizes, and so needed splash images in corresponding sizes. I also designed an icon to fit the subject and convey the idea visually. Last step before implementing was to make a styletile as guide for coding the website. My design process can be found <a href="img/portfolio/streetart/Streetart_malou_vincents.pdf" class="red">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The site was coded in HTML and CSS using Brackets.</p>
