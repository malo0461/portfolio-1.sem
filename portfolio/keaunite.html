        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>The brief for this projekt was to make an app for multimedia design and communication students at KEA. It was encouraged that the app could branch out to other departments as well, and even outside KEA.</p>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>We followed the SCRUM methodology, and were also introduced to new strategies: experience maps, design charette, paper prototype testing and benchmarking. The pictures used in the app had to be self-generated, no stock images.</p>

        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>The project started with an in-class survey, which gave us material for data mining. After brainstorming, our group had three app-ideas: KEA Tutor, KEA Schedule and KEA Unite. We conducted think-aloud protocols on our classmates (the target group) with paper prototypes of all three ideas. Benchmarking gave an overview of their respective strengths, and gave us quantifiable grounds to choose to go forth with KEA Unite - an app for budding entrepreneurs at KEA.</p>
        <p>Our process was uploaded to a
            <a href="http://malouvincents.dk/kea/04-ux/app/UX-master/index.html" class="red">
                documentation website</a>. We coded a <a href="http://malouvincents.dk/kea/04-ux/app/UX-master/app.html" class="red">presentation website</a> for the pitch to the customer &#40;the KEA Digital administration&#41;.</p>

        <p>Our app layout was designed in Adobe Photoshop, and imported to XD to make a digital prototype. We performed another think-aloud protocol to rid the app of the last defects.</p>

        <p>The photos used for the main menu were taken at KEA's respective departments with a Canon 7D DSLR, and edited in postprocessing to have a unified expression.</p>

        <p>The websites were coded in HTML and CSS using Brackets.</p>
