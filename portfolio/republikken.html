        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>The brief for this projekt was to make an app for the office community Republikken and its customers.</p>

        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>We followed the SCRUM methodology for group work, and used the business model canvas by means of illuminating Republikken's company strategy and relationship with customers.</p>

        <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>Republikken had conducted a member survey, which gave us material for data mining. After brainstorming, making paper prototypes and benchmarking, the choice settled on R Connect.</p>

        <p>Our process was uploaded to a
            <a href="http://malouvincents.dk/kea/04-ux/republikken/dokumentationsside.html" class="red">
                documentation website</a>. We coded a <a href="http://malouvincents.dk/kea/04-ux/republikken/pr%C3%A6sentationsside.html" class="red">presentation website</a> for the pitch to the customer &#40;Republikken&#41;.</p>

        <p>Our app layout was designed in Adobe Photoshop, and imported to XD to make a digital prototype.</p>

        <p>The websites were coded in HTML and CSS using Brackets.</p>

        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>I was involved only in the last half of this project; if this hadn't been the case, I would have liked to evovle the concept into more of a visual sharing platform, and also to bring a more minimalist approach to the design.</p>
